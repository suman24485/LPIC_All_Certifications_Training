101.1 Determine and Configure h/w settings(Filesystem and Device Files)

everything on lnx dist is treated as a file - this simplifies how we work with devices and apps on the system

Special filesystems - pseudo filesystems 
	contains info abt system hw or state of the system
		procfs - 
			$df -h
			
			$cat /etc/fstab
			lists out all the filesystems and mounts configured on the machine.
			
			#cd /proc
				contains numbered directories corresponds to the running processes
				
			#cd 1
				contains hte directories and info about the particular process
			#cd /proc
			#cat mounts
			#cat interrupts
			#cat ioports - addresses that identify a device and kernel module that it is associated with
			#cat dma - a device can use system memory directly
			#cat usb
			#cat pci
			
		sysfs - 
			designed to adddress problems iwth proc which is unorganized data
			#cd /sys
			#cd block 
			
		dev - not a filesystem but its a method of listing the hw within a directory and they correspond to device on the system
			#cd /dev
			#ls
			hotplugin or hot swapping
		
		udev system

101.1 Determine and Configure h/w settings(Tools and Utilies to Explore system devices)
	
	lsmod - list kernel modules that are loaded into memory along with the dependencies
	#man lsmod
	#lsmod
	
	lscpu - information about the CPU architecture
	#man lscpu
	#lscpu
	#lscpu -a
	#lscpu -ae
	#lscpu --parse
	
	#lspci
	#lspci -v
	#lspci -vmm
	#lspci -t
	#lspci -tv
	
	#lsscsi - looks for scsi or sata devices
	#lsscsi
	#lsscsi -d
	#lsscsi -g
	#lsscsi -s
	#lsscsi -v
	#lsscsi -l
	
	#lsblk - lists block devices on the system
	#lsblk -f 
	#lsblk -t
